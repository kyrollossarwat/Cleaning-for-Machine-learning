# Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning Model Preparation

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to understand its characteristics, clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values and outliers, and create insightful visualizations. The ultimate goal is to prepare the data effectively for training a machine learning model.

The steps involved in this EDA process include:

* Loading and inspecting the dataset.
* Identifying and handling missing values.
* Detecting and managing outliers.
* Creating various visualizations to understand feature distributions, relationships, and patterns.
* Potentially performing feature encoding and scaling to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were utilized in this EDA project:

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis, particularly working with DataFrames (`import pandas as pd`).
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations and array operations (`import numpy as np`).
* **Matplotlib:** For creating basic plots and visualizations (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`).
* **Seaborn:** For generating more advanced and statistically informative visualizations (`import seaborn as sns`).
* **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** For data preprocessing tasks:
    * `LabelEncoder` for encoding categorical features (`from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder`).
    * `StandardScaler` for standardizing numerical features (`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`).
